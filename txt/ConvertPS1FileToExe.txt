1. Use PS2EXE
PS2EXE is a PowerShell module that can compile a PS1 script into an EXE file.

Install PS2EXE: Install-Module PS2EXE

1.2. Then compile the script: PS2EXE-GUI .\ascii-art-launcher.ps1  or  PS2EXE .\ascii-art-launcher.ps1

This will generate an EXE that can be distributed and run on other Windows machines.

Including custom icon "PS2EXE -InputFile .\Youtube.ps1 -OutputFile Youtube.exe -Icon ./src/icon/icon.ico

"

Other method

1. Use a Self-Extracting Archive
You can package the PS1 script along with PowerShell into a self-extracting archive that will extract and launch the script when run.

Use a tool like 7-Zip or WinRAR to create a self-extracting EXE with the PS1 and PowerShell inside.

2. Use Win-PS2EXE
Win-PS2EXE is another utility to convert PS1 to EXE. You can install it via: 
1.1 Install-Script -Name Win-PS2EXE
1.2 Win-PS2EXE -PS1 .\ascii-art-launcher.ps1 -Output .\launcher.exe

3.  Compile C# Wrapper with PS1 Embedded
You can create a C# wrapper app that launches PowerShell and executes the embedded PS1 script. This allows compiling to a native EXE

Python Exe installer:

pyinstaller --onefile --icon=iconicon.ico --add-data=iconicon.ico;icon --specpath=. About.py coreTubemp3.py coreTubeVid.py my_scripts.spec
